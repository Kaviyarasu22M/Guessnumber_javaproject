Guess Number Game
Description
This is a simple "Guess the Number" game implemented in Java. The program generates a random number between 1 and 50. The user is asked to guess the number, and the program will give hints (whether the guess is too high or too low) until the correct number is guessed. Once the user guesses the correct number, the program will display a congratulatory message and stop.
